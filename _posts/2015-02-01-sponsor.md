# Support

Argon was created as part of the [Argon Research Project](http://argon.gatech.edu) in the [Augmented Environments Lab](http://ael.gatech.edu/lab) at Georgia Tech, with support from the National Science Foundation, Georgia Tech's GVU Center and Institute for People and Technology, and companies including Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent.  

Argon is now an independent open-source project, supported by the [Augmented Environments Lab](http://ael.gatech.edu/lab) at Georgia Tech and by [Mozilla](http://mozilla.com). If you would like to support the Argon Open-Source project in some way, please contact the [Blair MacIntyre](mailto:blair@cc.gatech.edu).  

More information about the ongoing Argon-related research at Georgia Tech can be found on the [Argon Research Project](http://argon.gatech.edu) pages.
