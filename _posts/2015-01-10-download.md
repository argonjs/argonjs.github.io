We are in the process of moving the source for the project to this collection of GitHub repositories, using the Apache 2.0 Open Source License. 
We will soon have the full source code for the project, tutorials, documentation and detailed examples of how to use Argon and argon.js to create 
a wide variety of AR experiences.

The iOS Argon3 Browser application is available on the iTunes App Store.
